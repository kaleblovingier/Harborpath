# HarborPath Improvement Roadmap

Generated from parallel specialized agent review (Clinical, Accessibility, Insurance & Safety-Net Matching, Guided Navigation, QA & Privacy Verification) to make HarborPath useful to more individuals seeking addiction treatment, clinical care, medications, harm reduction, and safety-net healthcare.

All implementations preserve HarborPath's core privacy guarantees: CSP `default-src 'self'` (100% identical between `src/app.js` and `vercel.json`), no third-party scripts, location coarsening to ~1 km, ASAM/insurance/guided triage/safety plan 100% client-side in browser RAM, zero query logging, and not a covered entity.

## 1. Clinical Expansion & Phase 1 Population Care Pathways (`#/navigator`, `populationHelpers.js`)

Extended the pure functions in `public/js/views/navigator.js` (`evaluateAsamCare`, `scoreOpioidWithdrawal`, `scoreAlcoholSedativeRisk`, `evaluateTransitionRisk`, `formatAsamHandoffText`) and integrated the Phase 1 population recommenders in `public/js/views/populationHelpers.js` (`ALL_POPULATION_RECOMMENDERS`):

- **Pregnancy / postpartum (`recommendForPregnancy`)**: Dedicated ACOG-aligned perinatal path prioritizing specialty programs (`PW`), agonist MOUD maintenance (`BU`, `MU`/`OTP`) over abrupt detox, hospital inpatient (`HI` / `DT`) when medically indicated, Medicaid (`MD`), and sliding scale (`SS`), plus federal CAPTA Plans of Safe Care guidance.
- **Adolescents / young adults (`recommendForYouth`)**: Youth-specific scoring and filters (`ADOL`, `YA`) linked to age-appropriate intensive outpatient (`IOP`), residential (`RES`), and telehealth (`TELE`) care, with consent and family policy guidance.
- **Justice-involved / reentry (`recommendForJusticeInvolved`)**: Integrated with `evaluateTransitionRisk` (`post_release`) to flag acute post-incarceration opioid receptor tolerance loss and fatal fentanyl overdose spikes in the first 7–14 days after release, routing to `CJ`, `OTP`, `BU`, `OP`, `NOE`, and `PEER`.
- **Xylazine / medetomidine exposure (`recommendForXylazine`)**: Addresses non-opioid alpha-2 adrenergic rebound hypertension/autonomic instability with clonidine/tizanidine/dexmedetomidine guidance alongside MOUD (`BU`, `OTP`, `DT`, `NOE`) and necrotic wound care (`HI`, `#/health`).
- **Older adults (`recommendForOlderAdults`)**: `SEN`, `OP`, `MD`, and `MHSU` filters with medical comorbidity and Medicare/Medicaid guidance.
- **Stimulant use (`recommendForStimulants`)**: Contingency Management (`CMI`), outpatient (`OP`), telehealth (`TELE`), and dual-diagnosis (`MHSU`) support.
- **Co-occurring serious mental illness (`recommendForCoOccurring`)**: Integrated dual-diagnosis (`MHSU`) and trauma-informed (`TRMA`) care with 988 and walk-in/mobile crisis (`WI`, `PEOFF`) escalation.

## 2. Zero-PII In-RAM Insurance & Safety-Net Compatibility Engine (`public/js/match/engine.js`, `insuranceHelpers.js`)

Evaluates insurance and safety-net affordability in browser RAM without transmitting coverage details to any server:

- **Deterministic Coverage Tiers**:
  - `EMTALA_PROTECTED`: Federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (`42 U.S.C. § 1395dd`) emergency screening and stabilization rights at hospital Emergency Departments regardless of insurance or ability to pay, paired with the DEA 72-Hour Rule (`21 CFR § 1306.07(b)`) for immediate buprenorphine or methadone administration.
  - `CONFIRMED_MATCH`: Explicitly sourced and dated network verification (`confirmed`).
  - `VERIFY_NETWORK`: Provider-reported SAMHSA payer match (`MD`, `MC`, `PI`, `TRICARE`, `VAF`, `ITU`) paired with an interactive insurer/clinic verification script covering **MHPAEA (Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act)** parity rights and **EKRA (`18 U.S.C. § 220`)** anti-patient-brokering warnings.
  - `SAFETY_NET_FALLBACK`: Sliding fee scale (`SS`), payment assistance (`PA`), free care (`NP`), HRSA FQHCs (`FQHC`), SAMHSA block grants (`SAMHSA`), and IHS/Tribal/Urban (`ITU`) safety-net options.
  - `UNVERIFIED_OR_MISMATCH`: Out-of-network or unlisted payment information with transparent verification prompts.
- **Distance-Preserving Ranking & State Medicaid Integration**: Preserves finite mileage (`miles`) across merged local and statewide telehealth listings, never allows paid or sponsored flags to influence scores, and links directly to all 56 state, DC, and U.S. territory Medicaid agencies in `data/state-medicaid.json`.

## 3. Privacy-First Deterministic Guided Navigator (`#/guided`, `guidedNavigator.js`)

Step-by-step guided triage that walks visitors through care needs in plain language using pure on-device functions:

- **Instant Crisis & Overdose Red-Flag Interception**: Immediately intercepts life-threatening withdrawal, overdose, or mental health crisis signals and routes to **988** (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline), **911**, **Never Use Alone (`877-696-1996` / `800-484-3731`)**, **SafeSpot (`800-972-0590`)**, and `#/overdose` before any routine directory search.
- **Zero Network Leakage**: Executes 100% locally in browser RAM with zero `fetch()` calls, zero external URLs, and zero persistent storage.

## 4. Rural & U.S. Territory Equity & `@media print` Clinical Handouts

- **Rural & U.S. Territory Reach**: Offline Census geocoding (`src/geo.js`, `src/regions.js`), up to 250-mile search radius expansion, and regional Medicaid/behavioral health directories covering all 50 states, DC, **Puerto Rico (`PR`)**, **Guam (`GU`)**, **U.S. Virgin Islands (`VI`)**, **American Samoa (`AS`)**, and the **Northern Mariana Islands (`MP`)**.
- **Print-Ready Handouts (`@media print`)**: Dedicated print stylesheets in `public/styles.css` for clinical ASAM self-check handoff summaries (`#/navigator`), personal safety & recovery action plans (`#/plan`), and side-by-side treatment comparison plans (`#/match`).

## 5. Global Quick Exit (`Esc` x2) Deterministic State Orchestration

- Pressing the **Quick exit** button or `Esc` twice within 1 second deterministically wipes all in-memory and device state (`wipeAll()`, plus `resetNavigatorState`, `resetInsuranceState`, and `resetGuidedNavigatorState`), clears any opt-in Service Worker offline cache (`public/sw.js`), replaces the DOM and document title with `'Weather'`, and redirects via `location.replace('https://www.weather.gov/')` while occupying a single back-history slot.

Not medical advice. HarborPath never endorses providers or accepts payment for listings.
